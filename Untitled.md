Welcome to Markdown PRO!
=========================

Here is an overview of the markdown syntax. Feel free to save this document and use it for reference later.

A few tricks to start with:

- Put a blank line in between to start a new paragraph
- If you want a line break, end your line with two spaces 


Paragraph
=========

One or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more blank lines.
 
This is another paragraph.

And another!

Section Headings
================

There are two ways to do headers in Markdown.  

You can underline text to make the two top-level headers:

Header 1
========

Header 2
--------

The number of `=` or `-` signs doesn't matter; you can get away with just one.  But using enough to underline the text makes your titles look better in plain text.

You can also use hash marks for all six levels of HTML headers:

# Header 1 #
## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###
#### Header 4 ####
##### Header 5 #####
###### Header 6 ######

The closing `#` characters are optional.  
  

Phrase Emphasis  
================


*This is italicized*, and so is _this_.  

**This is bold**, and so is __this__.

You can use ***italics and bold together*** if you ___have to___.



Horizontal Rules
================

You can insert a horizontal rule by putting three or more hyphens on a line by themselves:

---


Blockquotes
===========

Blockquotes are indented:

> The syntax is based on the way email programs
> usually do quotations. You don't need to hard-wrap
> the paragraphs in your blockquotes, but it looks much nicer if you do.  Depends how lazy you feel.
> Looks good!



Lists
=====

A bulleted list:

- You can use a minus sign for a bullet
+ Or plus sign
* Or an asterisk

A numbered list:

1. Numbered lists are easy
2. Markdown keeps track of the numbers for you
7. So this will be item 3.

Links
=====

Here's an inline link to [Google](http://www.google.com/).

You can write bare URLs or email addresses by enclosing them in angle brackets:

> My web site is at <http://www.markdownpro.com>  
> My email address is: <support@markdownpro.com>


Images
======

Images are exactly like inline links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them:

![Valid XHTML](http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10).

The word in square brackets is the alt text, which gets displayed if the browser can't show the image.  Be sure to include meaningful alt text for blind users' screen-reader software.


Special sections (Notes, Tips, etc.)
===================================

To make a special section, indent four spaces:

    NOTE: This is some other cool stuff we can do with Markdown PRO! 
	       Of course, it can be a paragraph inside a note.


Use backticks to create a special formatted section inline. (The backtick key is in the upper left corner of most keyboards)

This is `really` expensive item, lots of `$`.


Tables
====================


 First Header  | Second Header 
 ------------- | ------------- 
 Row1 Cell1    | Row1 Cell2    
 Row2 Cell1    | Row2 Cell2    


* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)

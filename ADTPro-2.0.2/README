Welcome to ADTPro!
------------------

Detailed setup instructions are available on the web:
http://adtpro.sourceforge.net

The ADTPro distribution comes as a single file named
something similar to ADTPro-v.r.m with an extension
particular to the target platform:

  * ADTPro-v.r.m.tar.gz - Linux or Solaris
  * ADTPro-v.r.m.dmg - Mac OSX
  * ADTPro-v.r.m.zip - Windows or OS/2

Your distribution should contain most of these, depending on platform:

 * ADTPro-v.r.m.app       - OSX server application for OSX 10.3 and above
 * adtpro.command         - OSX server startup command file for OSX 10.2 and below
 * adtpro.bat             - Windows server startup batch file
 * adtpro.cmd             - OS/2 server startup batch file
 * adtpro.sh              - Linux/Solaris server startup
                            shell script
 * ac.sh                  - AppleCommander command line shell script invoker
 * ac.bat                 - AppleCommander command line batch file invoker
 * LICENSE                - The GNU Public License file
 * README                 - The info you're looking at now
 * disks/ADTPRO-v.r.m.DSK - ADTPro ProDOS client-side software
                            (an Apple 140K disk image)
 * disks/ADTPROSOS-v.r.m.DSK - ADTPro SOS client-side software
                            (an Apple 140K disk image)
 * disks/ADTPRO-v.r.m.PO  - ADTPro client-side software
                            (an Apple 800K disk image)
 * disks/ADTvr.DSK        - An enhanced legacy Apple DOS ADT
                            client, capable of running on the
                            Super Serial hardware, the IIgs
                            serial (modem) port, and the
                            IIc/Laser 128 modem port
 * disks/VDRIVE-v.r.m.DSK - Virtual drive driver support for Apple II and ///
                            (an Apple 140K disk image)
 * disks/Virtual[2].po    - Blank example virtual disks
                            (Apple 800K disk images)
 * lib/ADTPro-v.r.m.jar   - ADTPro server-side software
                            (a Java .jar file)
 * lib/rxtx/...           - Java serial library files
 * lib/AppleCommander/AppleCommander-v.r.m.p-ac.jar
                          - AppleCommander support Jar

In all cases above, v.r.m is replaced with the version, release 
and modification numbers of the current distribution.

To get started, you will need a Java installation you can call
from the host computer's command line. This means that if you type
the command "java -version" from a terminal window it ought to
produce output other than complaints. One place to get a downloadable
Java distribution is from Sun Microsystems: Sun JRE download. When
you get there, look for a "Java Runtime Environment (JRE)" download
for your platform and install it.

After downloading the ADTPro distribution file to your desktop,
unpack it using your operating system's native facilities. You can
either run the server startup program from the command line or, in
Windows and OSX, double-click on the icon of the startup program:

Linux, Solaris: adtpro.sh
OS/2:           adtpro.cmd
OSX:            ADTPro-v.r.m.app or adtpro.command
Windows:        adtpro.bat

You can modify the startup program to suit your environment.
Especially for the Unix variants - it may need a little tweaking to
get the correct native serial library connected.

When starting, you will see the following information echoed back
on your console as the GUI is coming up:

   ADTPro Server version v.r.m

When the ADTPro GUI comes up, click one of the three connection
buttons to choose your communications type.

If you currently use the DOS ADT program, select the Serial button.
You can transfer the ADTPro-v.r.m.dsk file to your apple using the
DOS ADT client and ADTPro server. Reboot your Apple with the new
ADTPro client disk in the disk drive and you're ready to go!

If you aren't already using DOS ADT, or if you don't have any
software for your Apple yet, there's lots of help available. Start
at ADTPro's bootstrapping page to get the software transferred to
your Apple.

Please report troubles, bugs, requests for help, etc. on the Help
forum for ADTPro at SourceForge:

Good luck - and have fun!

Unix RXTX Considerations
------------------------

The adtpro.sh file can be customized to suit your environment.
The main thing to do is to choose your platform for RXTX support.
You may need to tweak the check for what your operating system
returns from the uname command, and connect that to the
appropriate RXTX library directory.

If you don't specify the right one, or if your platform is
unsupported by RXTX, you will get an error similar to the one below
on startup:

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't find library rxtxSerial
  (librxtxSerial.so) in sun.boot.library.path or java.library.path
sun.boot.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin
java.library.path=/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:
 /opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin/classic:/opt/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin:/usr/lib
 thrown while loading gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

Keep working at your startup script or take a look at the RXTX install
instructions in the rxtx directory. Remember, you can always ask for
help in the ADTPro help forum:
